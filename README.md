# React firebase chat app

Live demo: https://chat-app-eight-psi-37.vercel.app/

Minimal functionality is completed. Things that are left to do: ~~realtime refresh of messages~~, images in chat, details buttons (~~blocked~~, chat images)

Inspired by Lama Dev (design and HTML template). Turned out to be a completely different project under the hood.

Technologies used to make this project different from Lama Dev's:

-   Supabase instead of Firebase
-   SCSS instead of CSS
-   TypeScript
-   Redux
-   Minor changes to design (might revise later)
-   Different app structure (components in one directory, styles in another directory)
